This program uses the Decision Tree Classification algorithm to screen resumes and predict whether a candidate will be hired based on their work experience, education level, and other factors. The program reads in a dataset of resumes with corresponding hiring outcomes and applies the Decision Tree Classification algorithm to the data. It then outputs predictions for new resumes that are input into the program.

Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the program:
  1. numpy
  2. pandas
  3. scikit-learn

Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:
  
  Make sure the required libraries are installed.
  Download the DecisionTreesClassificationDataSet.csv dataset and save it in the same directory as the program.
  Run the program.
  The program will output predictions for two example resumes based on their work experience, education level, and other factors. To test the program with   other resumes, simply modify the input values in the predict method calls at the bottom of the program.

Dataset
The dataset used in this program is DecisionTreesClassificationDataSet.csv. It contains information on the work experience, education level, and other factors for a number of job candidates, as well as whether they were ultimately hired or not.
